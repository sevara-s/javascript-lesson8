Array methods in Javascript
let arr = ["iajdfh","dhfiu", 1, 78, "salom dunyo"];
1) arr.length --> this method returns  the length of array.
2)arr.at(3)--> this method returns the value in the 3 index.
3)arr.pop() --> removes the last element of an array. Also when we can store the element that was removed to the variable end return the removed element
4)arr.shift() --> removes the first index of element.
5)arr.unshift() --> adds the new element at the beginning of array.
6) with concat() methods we can add two excisting array to one new array.
For example: 
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
let vegies = ["cucumber"];

let food = fruits.concat(vegies);
7) arr.toString() --> this methods converts array elements to string 
8)arr.push()-->add new element to the array from the end
